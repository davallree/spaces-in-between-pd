# Panels

Build interactive comics for the Playdate console.

![Banner](./assets/images/panelsBanner.gif)

Provide Panels with a Lua table that describes the sequences in your comic (scroll direction, panel sizes, text, animation and effects) along with your layered graphics. Panels will handle layout, scrolling, animation, and even chapter navigation for you.

Comics built with Panels can support these features:

-   layered, parallax scrolling
-   nested panels
-   sequences with different scroll directions
-   manual (crank) scrolling and auto advancing (panel-by-panel)
-   panel effects like shake and blink
-   animated transitions between sequences
-   animations and transitions within panels based on scroll position
-   animated text layers
-   panels with fully custom render functions

    This is a [Template Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Click "Use this template" to create your own fresh repo with all the contents of the project template.
2. The template project includes the Panels framework as a git submodule. Be sure to properly [initialize the submodule](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/git/how-to-clone-including-submodules.html) when cloning the repo.
3. Start editing table in `myComicData.lua`.

### Manual Setup

1. Clone this repo into your project into a `libraries` folder.
2. Inside your `main.lua` file import Panels.
3. Create or import your [`comicData`](http://cadin.github.io/panels/docs/comic-data) table.
4. Start Panels with your `comicData` table as the sole argument.

### Example `main.lua` File:

```lua
import "libraries/panels/Panels"
local comicData = {
    -- comic data goes here...
}
Panels.start(comicData)
```
